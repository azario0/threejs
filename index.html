        Three.js is a popular JavaScript library used to create and display
        animated 3D graphics in a web browser. It is built on top of WebGL,
        which is a low-level graphics API that enables high-performance 2D and
        3D rendering within web pages. Three.js abstracts much of the complexity
        of WebGL, making it more accessible for developers to create
        sophisticated 3D visualizations, games, and interactive applications
        without needing to write extensive WebGL code.

        Key Features of Three.js Ease of Use: Three.js provides a more
        user-friendly interface compared to raw WebGL. <br> It includes many built-in
        objects, materials, lights, and shaders, which simplifies the creation
        of 3D scenes. <br> Cross-Platform: Since it runs in the browser, Three.js
        works across multiple platforms, including desktops, tablets, and mobile
        devices, as long as the device supports WebGL. <br> Extensive Documentation
        and Examples: Three.js comes with comprehensive documentation and
        numerous examples, which helps developers quickly learn and implement
        its features. <br> Animations and Interactions: It supports animations,
        including skeletal animations for characters and keyframe animations. <br>It
        also facilitates user interactions such as mouse and touch events. Scene
        Graph: Three.js uses a scene graph structure, allowing developers to
        easily manage and manipulate objects within a 3D scene.
